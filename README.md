0h game jam 2017  -> 0hgame.eu

third time I participate in this edition 

I started this project on October 29th 2017 at 02:00am, and finished it on October 29th 2017 at 02:00am. Amazing isn't it? A game made with no time? Yup! Enjoy it! (for those who are sceptical about it, http://0hgame.eu/)

The rules:
This time it has rules explained ingame dfjpasdijhfals
Anyway I'm keeping last year's rule -> Enjoy it. (it is a rule, so if you are not enjoying the game is because you are not following the rules)
